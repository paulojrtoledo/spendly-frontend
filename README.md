# Spendly 💰 — Frontend

Spendly is a modern personal finance management platform frontend built with a strong focus on scalability, clean architecture, user experience and real-world frontend engineering practices.

The application simulates the frontend layer of a real financial product, including authentication flows, protected routes, wallet management, financial transactions, authenticated financial dashboard data and integration with a Spring Boot backend API deployed on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.

> 🚧 **Project Status:** Active Development / Live Demo Available
> This project is still evolving, but it already has a functional deployed demo environment.

---

# 🌐 Live Demo

The Spendly frontend is deployed on Vercel and communicates with the backend through a Vercel API proxy.

> 🔗 **Live Application:**
> https://spendly-fawn.vercel.app

## Demo Access

The application includes isolated guest access for portfolio demonstration purposes.

On the login screen, click:

```txt
Entrar como visitante
```

Each click sends `POST /auth/guest` without requesting a CPF or password. The backend creates a unique temporary customer and returns a standard JWT, which the frontend processes through the normal authentication flow.

Guest sessions do not share wallets or transactions. Each temporary account starts without wallets or transactions, and all data remains isolated by the authenticated customer.

---

# 🌎 Language Note

This README is written in English to make the project more accessible to international recruiters, developers and technical reviewers.

The application interface is currently in Portuguese because Spendly simulates a personal finance product designed for Brazilian users, including CPF-based authentication, localized financial categories and user-facing flows adapted to the Brazilian context.

This separation reflects a common professional approach: technical documentation, code structure and repository communication in English, while the product interface follows the language of its target users.

# Phase 6 — Deployment and Public Demo (Completed)

The frontend is deployed on Vercel and integrated with the backend hosted on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.

## Deployment architecture

```txt
User
↓
Vercel Frontend
↓
/api proxy
↓
Spring Boot Backend on OCI VM
↓
Neon PostgreSQL Database
```

## Deployment features

* Frontend deployed on Vercel
* Backend deployed on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure
* PostgreSQL database hosted on Neon
* Vercel proxy configured through `/api`
* SPA fallback configured for React Router routes
* Environment-based API URL configuration
* Isolated guest access working in production

## Vercel proxy

The frontend uses Vercel rewrites to avoid mixed content issues between the HTTPS frontend and the HTTP backend currently hosted on OCI.

Production frontend calls:

```txt
/api/auth/login
/api/auth/guest
/api/customers/me
/api/wallets
/api/transactions
/api/transactions/{id}/reverse
/api/dashboard/summary
```

Vercel forwards those requests to the backend API:

```txt
http://163.176.202.5:8080
```

## SPA fallback

The project also includes a fallback rewrite for React Router routes, preventing `404 NOT_FOUND` errors when refreshing internal pages such as:

```txt
/dashboard
/wallets
/transactions
```

---

# 🔐 Authentication Architecture

The authentication system was structured using React Context API and protected routing.

## Implemented Components

| Component         | Responsibility                                           |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| AuthContext       | Global authentication state                              |
| ProtectedRoute    | Blocks unauthenticated access                            |
| PublicRoute       | Prevents authenticated users from accessing public pages |
| Axios Interceptor | Automatically attaches JWT token                         |
| LoginPage         | Public authentication screen                             |
| DashboardPage     | Initial authenticated financial overview                 |

---

# 🔄 Authentication Flow

1. User submits CPF and password
2. Frontend sends request to backend
3. Backend validates credentials
4. JWT token is returned
5. Token is stored locally
6. AuthContext hydrates authentication state
7. Protected routes become accessible
8. Axios automatically attaches Authorization header
9. Invalid sessions automatically logout the user
10. User is redirected to login when authentication is no longer valid

## Guest Authentication Flow

1. Visitor clicks `Entrar como visitante`
2. Frontend sends `POST /auth/guest` without a request body
3. Backend creates a unique temporary customer
4. Backend returns the standard JWT response
5. Frontend stores the token using the normal authentication flow
6. AuthContext loads `/customers/me`
7. PublicRoute redirects to `/dashboard`
8. The visitor sees only their own wallets and transactions

---

# 🌐 API Integration

The frontend communicates with the Spendly backend API through Axios.

In local development, the frontend can communicate directly with the local backend:

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8080
```

In production, the frontend uses the Vercel proxy:

```env
VITE_API_URL=/api
```

This allows the deployed frontend to call relative API routes while Vercel forwards requests to the backend hosted on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.

---

# Authentication

## Login

```http
POST /auth/login
```

### Request

```json
{
  "cpf": "12345678901",
  "password": "123456"
}
```

### Response

```json
{
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9...",
  "type": "Bearer"
}
```

---

## Guest Session

```http
POST /auth/guest
```

The request does not include a body. The backend creates a unique temporary customer and returns the same JWT contract used by normal login:

```json
{
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9...",
  "type": "Bearer"
}
```

The response does not expose the generated CPF, email or password.

---

## Register Customer

```http
POST /customers
```

### Request

```json
{
  "name": "Paulo Emilio",
  "cpf": "12345678901",
  "password": "123456",
  "email": "paulo@email.com"
}
```

---

## Current Authenticated User

```http
GET /customers/me
```

### Headers

```http
Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>
```

---

# 💼 Wallet Endpoints

## List Wallets

```http
GET /wallets
```

---

## Create Wallet

```http
POST /wallets
```

### Request

```json
{
  "name": "Santander",
  "walletType": "BANK_ACCOUNT",
  "initialBalance": 500
}
```

---

## Update Wallet

```http
PATCH /wallets/{id}
```

---

## Deactivate Wallet

```http
DELETE /wallets/{id}
```

---

# 💸 Transaction Endpoints

## Create Transaction

```http
POST /transactions
```

### Request

```json
{
  "walletId": 1,
  "type": "EXPENSE",
  "category": "FOOD",
  "amount": 100,
  "description": "Market"
}
```

---

## List Transactions

```http
GET /transactions
```

---

## Get Transaction By ID

```http
GET /transactions/{id}
```

---

## Reverse Transaction

```http
POST /transactions/{id}/reverse
```

The endpoint does not require a request body. Only `ACTIVE` transactions can be reversed. The response contains the updated transaction with status `REVERSED`; its financial impact is reverted, the wallet balance is restored, and the transaction remains in history.

---

# 📊 Dashboard Endpoints

## Get Authenticated Financial Summary

```http
GET /dashboard/summary
```
